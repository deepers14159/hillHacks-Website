        <p>hillsHacks is the second annual hackathon hosted by Watchung Hills! A hackathon is an event where a large number of people come together to explore and be inspired by computer science and technology.</p>
        <p>Throughout the afternoon, beginners and experts alike can explore computer science through demos, talks, and workshops.  Learn how computer science is being applied to space exploration and medicine! Learn the basics of Python or JavaScript! Learn about the development process as high school students showcase their projects! <b>No prior experience is required.</b></p>
        <p>Since the theme for hillsHacks 2019 is “Coding the Classroom”, at the end of the day, participants will be challenged to improve the classroom experience through innovative technological solutions. To conclude the event, everyone will have the opportunity to showcase what they’ve been working on in an informal sales pitch. While judges will select a few projects to win prizes, we would like to stress that prizes are not the main focus of the event, and are only meant to reward participants for their hard work.</p>
        <p>The event will take place <b>Sunday May 19th, from 11:00 am to 6:00 pm</b>.</p>

        <h4>Why come to hillsHacks?</h4>
        <p>Computer science is on the path to near ubiquity worldwide and attending hackathons are a great way to develop your knowledge in coding. Regardless of your experience, you will learn something new at hillsHacks. All students grade 6 and up are welcome.</p>
        <h4>What if I don’t know anything about coding or computer science?</h4>
        <p>hillsHacks is your opportunity to learn!</p>
        <h4>I’m an expert at coding. What do I get out of this event?</h4>
        <p>As the first high school hackathon with a theme of educational technology, you’ll have the unique opportunity to apply your skills and create something that can help improve classrooms, possibly winning prizes as well. Also, by being with other people interested in computer science, you are bound to learn something new.</p>
        <h4>This sounds like a long day, will there be food?</h4>
        <p>Of course! All participants will be given lunch and dinner. Snacks will also be available throughout the day.</p>
        <h4>Do I need to bring my own computer?</h4>
        <p>We do recommend that you bring your own computer, but we are trying to get school chromebooks for everyone to use. We will let you know.</p>
        <h4>Sounds great! Where is it?</h4>
        <p>It's at Watchung Hills Regional High School, which is at
        <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/108+Stirling+Rd,+Warren,+NJ+07059/">108 Stirling Rd, Warren, NJ 07059</a>. You should enter through the main entrance at the front of the school.</p>

                <h4> Structure of the Day </h4>
                <!-- <p>There are two main components to the event: free coding time and workshops. At any point throughout the day, groups can work on programming their own project or developing an idea and plan for a programming project, which can then be judged at the end and possibly be awarded prizes. This hackathon is themed around educational technology, so projects should focus on how technology can improve education. Occurring at the same time are workshops, which you can attend to learn more about some topic in computer science, including learning how to program if you don’t know how.</p>
                <p>You can choose to allocate your time however you wish, whether it is competing, learning, or just tinkering around with something. Often, there will be multiple workshops happening at the same time; there is a schedule below listing all of the workshops, and includes a brief description of each, as well as a guide for how to spend the day depending on your experience with programming. Also below is a diagram for you to visualize the entire schedule.</p>
                <p>Note that there are a few general events that everyone attends at the same time, listed below</p> -->
